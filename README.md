# Enhanced File Manager Actions for Linux

This project offers a collection of file manager actions, also known as Nautilus Scripts, meticulously crafted to enrich the functionality of file managers. With intuitive right-click actions on files and directories, it enhances the user experience seamlessly.

Compatible with file managers:

- [GNOME Files (Nautilus)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus)
- [Caja](https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja)
- [Dolphin](https://github.com/KDE/dolphin)
- [Nemo](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo)
- [PCManFM-Qt](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt)
- [Thunar](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar)

## Installing

To install, just run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
bash install.sh
```

## Advantages

While numerous scripts are available for file managers on the web, many suffer from poor functionality, lack of error checking, and dependency management. Some scripts only work with files that don't have special characters in their names, among other limitations. To address these shortcomings, I have developed my own set of scripts, which offer the following advantages:

- **Parallel task execution**: Processes multiple files simultaneously. Very fast!
- **Progress dialog**: Displays a progress dialog and allows interruption of tasks at any time.
- **Status notifications**: Notifies users of dependency errors and MIME types.
- **Dependency management**: Prompts users to install any missing dependencies.
- **Remote file support:** Works with files stored on remote servers.
- **Non-destructive output**: Never overwrites the input file; the output is distinct.
- **Log file**: Produces an `Errors.log` file when a task ends with an error.
- **Direct usage**: Direct usage without requiring input parameters.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Provides keyboard shortcuts for the scripts.
- **File manager compatibility**: Designed for major file managers like GNOME Files (Nautilus), Dolphin, Caja, Nemo and Thunar.
- **Distro compatibility**: Designed to work on major GNU/Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Fedora, and Manjaro.
- **Easy adaptation**: Scripts can be easily copied and adapted for other purposes.
- **Bash implementation**: All scripts are implemented in Bash. So, the scripts work well in the shell (without a graphical interface) and file managers.
- **Shell script validation**: All scripts have been checked using [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
